      <h2>About Shoofly Pie</h2>
      <p>
        Shoofly pie is a molasses crumb pie with its roots in Pennsylvania
        Dutch cuisine. Food historians believe the pie was created for the
        U.S. Centennial in 1876 and was originally called "molasses crumb
        pie"【975363348024864†L162-L215】. The now‑familiar name “shoofly” likely
        came later, inspired by a circus boxing mule whose name was adopted by a
        molasses company【975363348024864†L144-L152】.

        There are two main styles of shoofly pie. A
        <strong>wet bottom</strong> pie features a gooey molasses layer that seeps
        into the crust, while a <strong>dry bottom</strong> version has the
        filling mixed into the crumb topping for a more cake‑like texture【975363348024864†L144-L152】.
        Traditionally, shoofly pie was considered a breakfast coffee cake
        rather than a dessert【975363348024864†L154-L160】.

        Our mission is to celebrate this regional specialty by mapping and
        cataloging locations that serve authentic shoofly pies, whether wet,
        dry or both. We rely on publicly available sources and community tips
        to keep our database up to date.
